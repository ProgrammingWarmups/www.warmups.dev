<exercise id="1" title="Introduction to Variables">

- Variables are containers that store data
- This data can be used or changed later in a program
- Variables are assigned the data they store using the `=` operator

Below, `name` is a variable that is assigned the data `John`:
```
name = "John"
```

The code below computes properties of a cuboid with a length of `10`, width of `11`, and height of `12`.

***Update the code to compute properties of a cuboid with a length of `13`, width of `14`, and height of `15`.***

<hr>

<codeblock id="intro_to_variables_01">

- The formula for a cuboid's base area is `length × width`
- The formula for a cuboid's surface area is `2 × (length × width) + 2 × (length × height) + 2 × (width × height)`
- The formula for a cuboid's volume is `length × width × height`

</codeblock>

Here's the same code, but using variables to contain the length, width, and height.

***Update the code to compute properties of a cuboid with a length of `13`, width of `14`, and height of `15`.***

<hr>

<codeblock id="intro_to_variables_02">

- Only three values need to be updated

</codeblock>

A bit easier, right? Now, how do you know when to use variables?

**A good rule of thumb is to use variables to store data that could be reused later in the code.**
